[lib]
# When auto-detecting the "example" plugin, `zenohd` will look for a dynamic library named "zplugin_example"
# `zenohd` will expect the file to be named according to OS conventions:
#   - libzplugin_example.so on linux
#   - libzplugin_example.dylib on macOS
#   - zplugin_example.dll on Windows
name = "zplugin_example"
# This crate type will make `cargo` output a dynamic library instead of a rust static library
