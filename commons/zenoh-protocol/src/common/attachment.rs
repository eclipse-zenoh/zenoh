/// NOTE: 16 bits (2 bytes) may be prepended to the serialized message indicating the total length
///       in bytes of the message, resulting in the maximum length of a message being 65_535 bytes.
///       This is necessary in those stream-oriented transports (e.g., TCP) that do not preserve
///       the boundary of the serialized messages. The length is encoded as little-endian.
///       In any case, the length of a message must not exceed 65_535 bytes.
///
/// The Attachment can decorate any message (i.e., TransportMessage and ZenohMessage) and it allows to
/// append to the message any additional information. Since the information contained in the
/// Attachement is relevant only to the layer that provided them (e.g., Transport, Zenoh, User) it
/// is the duty of that layer to serialize and de-serialize the attachment whenever deemed necessary.
/// The attachement always contains serialized properties.
