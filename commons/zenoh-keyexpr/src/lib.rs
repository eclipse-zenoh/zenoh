//! [Key expression](https://github.com/eclipse-zenoh/roadmap/blob/main/rfcs/ALL/Key%20Expressions.md) are Zenoh's address space.
//!
//! In Zenoh, operations are performed on keys. To allow addressing multiple keys with a single operation, we use Key Expressions (KE).
//! KEs are a small language that express sets of keys through a glob-like language.
//!
//! These semantics can be a bit difficult to implement, so this module provides the following facilities:
//!
//! # Storing Key Expressions
//! This module provides 2 flavours to store strings that have been validated to respect the KE syntax, and a third is provided by [`zenoh`](https://docs.rs/zenoh):
//! - [`keyexpr`] is the equivalent of a [`str`],
//! - [`OwnedKeyExpr`] works like an [`Arc<str>`],
//! - [`KeyExpr`](https://docs.rs/zenoh/latest/zenoh/key_expr/struct.KeyExpr.html) works like a [`Cow<str>`], but also stores some additional context internal to Zenoh to optimize
//! routing and network usage.
//!
//! All of these types [`Deref`](core::ops::Deref) to [`keyexpr`], which notably has methods to check whether a given [`keyexpr::intersects`] with another,
//! or even if a [`keyexpr::includes`] another.
//!
//! # Tying values to Key Expressions
//! When storing values tied to Key Expressions, you might want something more specialized than a [`HashMap`](std::collections::HashMap) if you want to respect
//! the Key Expression semantics with high performance.
//!
//! Enter [KeTrees](keyexpr_tree). These are data-structures specially built to store KE-value pairs in a manner that supports the set-semantics of KEs.
//!
//! # Building and parsing Key Expressions
//! A common issue in REST API is the association of meaning to sections of the URL, and respecting that API in a convenient manner.
//! The same issue arises naturally when designing a KE space, and [`KeFormat`](format::KeFormat) was designed to help you with this,
//! both in constructing and in parsing KEs that fit the formats you've defined.
//!
//! [`kedefine`] also allows you to define formats at compile time, allowing a more performant, but more importantly safer and more convenient use of said formats,
//! as the [`keformat`] and [`kewrite`] macros will be able to tell you if you're attempting to set fields of the format that do not exist.
